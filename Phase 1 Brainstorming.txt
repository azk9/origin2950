Phase 1: Brainstorming Ideas

1. Breast Cancer Classifer
   DataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images/ 
   Research Question: Can this data be used to identify malignant breast cancer tumors?
   
   Oncogene classifer
   DataSet: https://www.mycancergenome.org/
   Research Questions: Can we identify patterns in oncogenes that can be used to identify new oncogenes inthe future?




2. Create Art from Soundwaves or Create an App that finds songs that song similar to each other
   DataSet: Audio data from songs
   
   
   

3. Cost of Cancer Treatment
   DataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/rishidamarla/costs-for-cancer-treatment


Questions for reviewers:
   - What should our research questions/goals for our project look like?
   - Just generally confused how we should go about analyzing this data?
